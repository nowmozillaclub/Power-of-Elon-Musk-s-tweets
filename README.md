TeslaTweets is a project where we try to predict whether Tesla's stock price will rise or fall based on Elon Musk's twitter data by using Machine Learning techniques and Natural Language Processing.

## Datasets

1. The [tweets dataset](datasets/data_elonmusk.csv) contains all of Elon Musk's tweets from November 16, 2012 to September 29, 2017. This dataset was taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kulgen/elon-musks-tweets).
2. The [stock price](datasets/tsla_stock_price.csv) was extracted using [pandas_datareader](https://pandas-datareader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Refer to the [code](datasets/extract_tsla_stock_price.py) for more information. This contains Date, Open, Close, Low, High prices and the Volume for Tesla's stock from November 16, 2012 to September 29, 2017.

## Building
